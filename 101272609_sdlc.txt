The Importance of DevOps in the SDLC (Summary)

DevOps plays a crucial role in making the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) — from planning, development, testing, and deployment to maintenance — faster, more efficient, and more reliable.

In traditional development, the development and operations teams work separately, often causing delays and miscommunication.
DevOps bridges this gap by integrating both teams and introducing automation, Continuous Integration (CI), and Continuous Deployment (CD) practices.

This results in:

Faster code delivery and deployment

Early detection of errors and improved software quality

Better collaboration between teams

Increased operational efficiency

Ultimately, DevOps transforms the SDLC into a continuous, stable, and high-quality process for delivering software to users.
