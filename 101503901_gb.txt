George Brown College

Who is George brown?
George Brown (1818-1880) was a 19th-century Scottish-born Canadian politician, newspaper publisher (he founded The Globe, precursor to The Globe and Mail) and was one of the Fathers of Confederation. 
An essential figure in the formation of Canada, Brown was a strong believer in public education.

In 1967, Canada’s centennial year, Bill Davis, then the Ontario Minister of Education, suggested that George Brown College would be a suitable name for the new college of applied arts and technology, noting:
 “the city to which George Brown added such lustre as a reformer, journalist, and statesman should honour him in this way.”
